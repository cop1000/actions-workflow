Let's use our first action, [Branch Cleanup](https://github.com/jessfraz/branch-cleanup-action). This action will [delete a branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10765321/should-i-delete-a-branch-after-merging-it) after anyone merges a pull request. The action must be a part of a workflow.

This course also includes steps to be completed with [zeit.co](https://zeit.co/). We'll walk you through the steps once we get there.

## Step 1: Create a workflow block

Let's create the workflow. We'll name it, and choose the event that will trigger the workflow.
