Great! The branch cleanup action is now ready to run. Although we haven't merged this pull request, any change to this pull request triggers the action. The fact that you just committed is one of those possible triggers (it's a `pull_request.synchronized` [event](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#events-supported-in-workflow-files), if you're curious). 

Activity: Wait for the branch cleanup action to run

This is an easy activity :wink: We'll just wait for the action to run. You can monitor the check status below.

I'll respond when the action runs.
