Great! Zeit reported that your deployment was successful.

To see your app running, click on the Actions tab and view the log of your action. At the bottom, you'll find the the url of your deployment. You can see the same information in your [Zeit dashboard](https://zeit.co/account/tokens). You should see something like this:

However, it's difficult to find this information. In the next few steps, we'll add an action to our workflow that'll make it easier to find.
