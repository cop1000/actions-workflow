Great! The branch cleanup action is now ready to run. Although we haven't merged this pull request, any change to this pull request triggers the action. The fact that you just committed is one of those possible triggers (it's a `pull_request.synchronized` [event](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#events-supported-in-workflow-files), if you're curious).

Wait for your action to run. You can monitor its progress in the Actions tab.
