Great! The branch cleanup action is now ready to run. Although we haven't merged this pull request, any change to this pull request triggers the action. The fact that you just committed is one of those possible triggers (it's a `pull_request.synchronized` [event](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#events-supported-in-workflow-files), if you're curious).

Wait for your action to run. Once it does, let's merge the pull request!

## Step 4: Merge the pull request
Once the action runs, let's fully test it by merging the pull request.

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your branch

1. Merge your branch
1. DO NOT delete your branch, wait for the action to do it for you

You can see the status of the action by going to the Actions tab.
